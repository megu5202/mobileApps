First Project: bacCalc2

Second Project: bac

Final Project: bacFinal
For the Final project I made the third tab into nested table views to allow the user to select a specific drink. I also included the CoreGraphics framework so that I could take a photo within the app to go along with a drink that would be selected. The original goal was to be able to take a picture of the specific drink and save it into the plist with the drink name and other information, but manipulating images to store and retreive from a plist proved to be a ridiculous headache. So instead you can just conveniently take a picture and store it to the camera roll whenever you are about to drink a drink.
