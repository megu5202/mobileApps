I will be making an app that will calculate a persons Blood Alcohol Content based 
on how many drinks they had, their gender, weight, and how long ago they started drinking.

There will be 4 text entry blocks for gender, weight, # of drinks, and how long ago 
they stared drinking
There will be one label that gives the current BAC

I will test the app by entering in different drinks, hours, weights and genders and
comparing the results to basic BAC graph data.

If this doesn't take too long I will try to change the equation so that you can enter
a time for each drink, so that the decay of BAC over time is more accurate.
